#  Welcome to my GitHubüëã
Hi, I'm Gon√ßalo! I‚Äôm currently a programming student at [42 Porto](https://www.42porto.com/), diving deep into C and software development.<br>
I love retro tech, sports, and learning how to build clean, efficient code.<br>
Parallel to 42, I'm also studying Web Development via the [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack Javascript course, as I aim<br>
to develop my own web app for people that love playing sports with their friends.
